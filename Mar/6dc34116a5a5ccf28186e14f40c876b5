I think it also goes to show that when you set your mind to something it can really come to life. “We didn’t know when or who it was gonna be, but we knew it would happen eventually,” he told IOL Entertainment recently. Titch’s death follows the passing of Chef Lentswe Bhengu, who passed away after a short illness, and hip hop artist AKA, who was gunned down along with his best friend and chef chef  Tebello 'Tibz' Motsoane, a month ago.  Titch and AKA had worked together on “You’re Welcome” in 2021. Since news of Titch’s passing, tributes have been pouring in online.  IOL Entertainment has contacted Ultra SA on the rapper's passing, they have confirmed that the rapper collapsed on stage and are awaiting an update. An official statement is yet to be released.
