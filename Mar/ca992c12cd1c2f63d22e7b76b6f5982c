AKA’s girlfriend Nadia Nakai has expressed her grief on social media, admitting to fans she was still struggling to come to terms with the rapper’s tragic death. Taking to her Insta Stories on Monday, the “Imma Boss” rapper shared the last conversation she had with AKA, real name Kiernan Forbes, minutes before his tragic passing. The rapper shared the screenshot of the last messages, where the love birds were exchanging love messages. In the messages, both parties insisted the other stay safe. AKA updated Nakai on his arrival in Durban and told her he was “headed to the hotel”, in the afternoon of that fateful day. Around 10:15pm, she texted him, asking for the song “Mbuzi” from his latest album “Mass Country” and she later informed him of her whereabouts but AKA never got to read the messages. “The fact that these messages were never delivered because you were gone💔,” she wrote on her Insta Stories. “I’m going to miss our FaceTimes, calls and texts…,” shared the star, with a broken heart emoji accompanying the post. The “Young, Famous & African” recently shared her pain at losing AKA, one month after his passing.
