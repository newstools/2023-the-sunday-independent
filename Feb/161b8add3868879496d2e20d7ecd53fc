Durban — A Durban school and a local non-profit organisation have worked together to provide free education to those who are less fortunate. Every Friday, Durban Girls’ College (DGC) and the Bhambayi Project come together to provide maths and literacy lessons to children. CEO and founder of the Bhambayi Project, Mandy Pearson, said the Maths Club started in 2012, and the collaboration with DGC began due to her daughters attending the school. “My three children who were schooling at DGC became involved and started inviting their friends to come along. “As the numbers grew, other DGC parents became involved in transporting their girls every week. There were about 20 DGC girls assisting each week. “Now the DGC bus takes the girls, and this has become a formal extramural school activity,” said Pearson. She added that the Bhambayi Project aims to transform everybody involved, not only the ‘beneficiaries’. Pearson said: “Core to this is what we call ‘eye2eye giving’. “It’s never about the ‘powerful’ giving to the ‘powerless’, but us all giving and growing together. This gives dignity and builds the future of our country.” She said this plays into the vision of the Maths Club, because on the one hand the helpers teach maths, but on the other, the orphans and vulnerable children teach them dancing. “The learning is two-way. Also, meaningful relationships grow across the economic divide,” said Pearson. WhatsApp your views about this story to 071 485 7995. Daily News
