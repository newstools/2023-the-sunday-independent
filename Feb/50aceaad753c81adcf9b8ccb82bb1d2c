Rustenburg - Stage 6 load shedding will be implemented from  Saturday night until Sunday morning , Eskom said on Saturday. “In order to create space to replenish the emergency generation reserves, Eskom will implement stage 6 load shedding from 20:00 tonight [Saturday] until 05:00 tomorrow [Sunday] morning. “Thereafter stage 4 load shedding will be implemented until further notice, with the possibility that stage 6 load shedding might again be implemented during Sunday night," Eskom said in a brief statement. Stage 6 load load shedding equates at least six hours without power a day, possibly in two-hour cycles. Stage 5 load shedding means around 5000 megawatts of electricity would be cut from the national grid in a staggered bid to prevent a complete grid collapse.
