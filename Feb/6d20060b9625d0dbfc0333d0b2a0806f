Scary,‚Äù one Twitter user @Nikiwemchunu said.  I wish Dj Zinhle could express and mourn openly however and whenever she wants. She didn‚Äôt have to include Bongani or Nadia to fabricate her true feelings for Aka in disguise. Like girl, stand up. We all knew you loved Aka unconditionally. Keep posting Aka! ‚ù§Ô∏è pic.twitter.com/Lf6KEpJzbB  ‚ÄúLol I remember when he said he doesn‚Äôt understand why she‚Äôs always posting his mom when she has her own mom ,‚Äù another user @ZeeRight highlighted.  To say I'm inspired by this woman would be an understatement, her level of maturity, her kindness, her love and her heartü•∫‚ù§Ô∏è, my goodness‚ù§Ô∏è. I just wish people would be more kinder to her, I really do. @DJZinhle . Strength and Love to you ‚ô•Ô∏è pic.twitter.com/SkSKL04NNQ
