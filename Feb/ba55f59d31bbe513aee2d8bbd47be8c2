Pretoria - Junior Blue Bulls player Ngcebo Thusi has abandoned his bid to be released out on bail for now. This was according to his legal counsel as the player appeared briefly in the Pretoria Magistrate’s Court earlier today for the alleged murder of his ex-girlfriend Ntokozo Xaba a third year Tshwane University of Technology student. As proceedings got underway Thusi attempted to have the media barred from taking his picture while in the dock, however, the presiding magistrate cited that he would allow photographs as the issue of gender-based violence was a huge societal matter. The legal counsel informed the court that as per Thusi's instruction he would not be seeking to apply for bail “at this stage” but may do so as proceedings continue.

Xaba, 21, who was doing her third year in Integrated Communications at the Tshwane University of Technology (TUT) was found dead in her room with stab wounds to her neck on February 2.
