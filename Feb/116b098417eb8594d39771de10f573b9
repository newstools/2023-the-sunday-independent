Durban - Parliament’s Joint Rules Committee is expected to take action against the EFF for its members’ behaviour during Thursday’s State of the Nation Address (Sona), when some of them swarmed onto the stage from where President Cyril Ramaphosa was delivering his speech.  Following several points of order raised by EFF leaders Julius Malema, Floyd Shivambu and Veronica Mente, Speaker Nosiviwe Mapisa-Nqakula resolved to eject them from the House.  On their way out, some EFF members rushed onto the stage. While the EFF has been known for disruptive behaviour during recent Sonas, this was the first time the party had stormed the podium from where the president was speaking – an action seen by many as a direct threat to him and to those on the stage with him.  But the EFF does not see anything wrong with its MPs’ behaviour, and has demanded that Mapisa-Nqakula apologise within 48 hours for ejecting them or the EFF would take the matter to the Constitutional Court. During a post-Sona news conference on Friday, Malema described MapisaNqakula’s decision to have Parliament’s security service remove him and his party as abhorrent, irresponsible, unconstitutional and totally unacceptable.  He said Mapisa-Nqakula would have 48 hours from the time of receiving their letter to publicly apologise, and that she should do so with the protection services. Malema added that they should do so at a news conference. Parliament spokesperson Moloto Mothapo said the Joint Rules Committee would first deal with the matter before advising on the way forward.
