Cape Town - Health expert and executive director of Grow Great, Dr Edzani Mphaphuli, has warned that child nutrition was at risk due to the low quality of food being consumed due to load shedding. Mphaphuli says children in schools, homes and early childhood centres are reportedly eating less fresh food and more fast food due to numerous factors such as the ongoing power outages. Power utility Eskom implemented Stage 6 load shedding on Tuesday morning, resulting in more rolling blackouts. Speaking to Newzroom Afrika, Mphaphuli said load shedding was putting parents in South Africa under intense financial pressure because of the current economic situation which influences their food choices. “Not only does the load shedding influence the quality of the food they are purchasing, as we continue experiencing power outages, we are not able to buy fresh foods in bulk anymore.

Mphaphuli said load shedding was impacting the country in the long-term and resulting in low nutrition and chronic disease and children are not growing properly because of the poor quality food they’re having to eat.
