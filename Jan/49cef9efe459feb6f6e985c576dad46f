Cape Town – Doing its bit to soften the financial burden to struggling parents ahead of the new school year, the Cape Coloured Congress (CCC) is running a mass back-to-school haircut drive across the city. With parents feeling the pressure of financial obligations including school fees, stationery and clothing, the initiative kicked off in Hout Bay on Tuesday. It saw school going boys of all ages queueing in excitement for a professional barbershop haircut. CCC president, Fadiel Adams said: “We did it in Hout Bay. Yesterday we went out to Mitchells Plain and Atlantis.  “We looked at the economic situation and the fact that it's time for kids to go back to school.  “Then there’s also load shedding and many people not having work in the new year, we just decided to do our bit.  “We helped save many unemployed parents at least R50 to R60 for a haircut so the kids can look and feel excited for school. “ While this was the first time they did the initiative, Adams said it would not be the last. “It was important, it's the first time, it will not be the last.  “We did about 60 haircuts on the first day and it was fantastic.  “We were as excited as the kids and the highlight was the smiles when they get off that chair. It was a privilege for us to be able to help.“  They also handed out school clothes to those in need. The initiative is running until Wednesday as they cover more areas. The Western Cape Education Department recently announced it was ready for the 2023 school year, as 35 872 teachers and 7 578 public service staff returned to schools on Monday to prepare for the arrival of over 1.2 million learners on Wednesday.
