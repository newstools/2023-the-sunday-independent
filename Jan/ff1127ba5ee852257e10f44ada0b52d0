Durban - An ANC member, who is a staunch advocate of the radical economic transformation (RET) grouping in the ruling party, says he has learned to develop a thick skin because of the criticism he has received over his views, which he says do not sit well with the current leadership. Nkosentsha Shezi, from the ANC’s eThekwini region in KwaZulu-Natal, who is also a strong supporter of former president Jacob Zuma, was speaking on the sidelines of the ruling party’s 111 birthday celebrations in Mangaung in the Free State on Sunday. The RET faction of the ANC is linked to Zuma, and has been critical of some of the decisions taken by the government since Cyril Ramaphosa became president. Shezi recently dismissed efforts by the ANC’s top brass to meet with Zuma, saying the gesture was simply a move to arrest the leadership’s declining popularity. Speaking to “The Mercury” on Sunday, the activist said he was unfazed by the criticism he had received since expressing his views on Ramaphosa and his team.  “I am not speaking for Zuma when making such comments, but merely articulating my and other comrades’ views on what we regard as critical matters that need to be attended to by our leaders,” said Shezi. He added that he would continue to speak unpopular truths in the ANC, and would not be a victim because he knew that the possible sidelining came with the territory. “I have come to understand that when one expresses views that may not be popular with many people there are consequences. My position is that I will not play victim in all of this,” said Shezi.  The ANC member expressed lukewarm feelings about the address delivered by Ramaphosa at the celebrations on Sunday, stressing that the reception of the January 8 statement illustrated the unstable state of affairs in the ruling party.
