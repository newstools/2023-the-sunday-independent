Johannesburg - In the early hours of Tuesday at around 1.10am, the Ekurhuleni Metro Police Department (EMPD) and officers from various law enforcement agencies intercepted three male suspects found attempting to steal electrical cables in the Brakpan area. EMPD spokesperson, Lieutenant colonel Kelebogile Thepa, said that members received information from private security staff on patrol that they’d seen three suspicious men digging a trench in a field on 10th Street in Vulcania South. “The law enforcers cornered the trio, who were unlawfully digging a ditch, just above where a 3mx185mmx3 core CU (11kv) PILC electrical copper cable, had been secured. The threesome, who are in their mid to late thirties in age, made an attempt to flee, but were apprehended following a brief chase,” Thepa said. According to the EMPD, a pickaxe, a shovel and a utility knife were recovered on the scene by the officers.  The handcuffed suspects, facing charges of tampering with essential infrastructure, were marched to Brakpan police station and they will soon be appearing in the Brakpan Magistrate’s Court. The Star
