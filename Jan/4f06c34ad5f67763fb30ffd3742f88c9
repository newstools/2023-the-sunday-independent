Durban – It was smiles all round when schoolchildren in the Blackburn Village informal settlement received a donation of stationery kits, lunch boxes, juice bottles, school bags and other essentials from the Sibaya Community Trust. According to the trust, a large number of the 8 000 people in the settlement live below the poverty line. Children from the community were placed at schools through the intervention of the eThekwini community participation unit.  Since many of the parents and caregivers of children in the settlement cannot afford the basic items needed for school, Sibaya Community Trust chairperson Vivian Reddy reached out to the community. Reddy said it was fulfilling to see the happiness and smiles on the faces of these children.  “It makes one realise that in serving others the most amount of joy can be derived,” he said.  The trust built a skills centre at Blackburn Village to help the residents learn skills. A kitchen was also built where daily meals are served to the poorest of the poor within the village. Reddy said that to date, the trust had spent R250 million on philanthropic responsibilities, making it one of the largest investors in social upliftment programmes in KZN. “While we may have funded a massive number of social projects, I pay tribute to those NPOs and entities who work hard on the ground to take care of our vulnerable citizens,” said Reddy. “We also appreciate the support provided by the leaders within the Blackburn community and the eThekwini Municipality who are spearheading various additional upliftment projects.” WhatsApp your views on this story to 071 485 7995 Daily News
