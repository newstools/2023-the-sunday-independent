Johannesburg - The yearly back-to-school period is generally a time of great excitement and fresh new beginnings for South Africa’s young people.  The Gender-Based Violence and Femicide (GBVF) Response Fund says for many it can also be a period of escape (at least for a little while each weekday) from gender-based violence and femicide (GBVF) taking place in their homes. But even schools can be places of danger, according to Tshepo Sefotlhelo, executive head: Marketing & Communication of the GBVF Response Fund. “Shockingly and sadly, the back-to-school period can also mark the start of a fearful and confusing time when our youth are exposed to abusers in and around the education system - whether these be educational professionals or classmates - resulting in many of our school-going youth becoming victims of GBVF themselves,” said Sefotlhelo. The GBVF Response Fund has encouraged South Africans to consider these facts: “As a society, we have a responsibility to create a safer and (physically, emotionally and psychologically) healthier youth.  We need to set the example in building-up and educating future generations to treat (themselves and) others with kindness and respect, through healthy forms of communication,” Sefotlhelo said.  “Parents, other care-givers and educators need to be role-models to this end, and even more importantly (alongside members of our justice system), be a safe haven for our youth to speak-up, so that they can be protected from harmful situations.  We need to work together to put an end to GBVF in our lifetimes.” The Star
