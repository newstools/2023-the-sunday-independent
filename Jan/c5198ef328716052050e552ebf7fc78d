Johannesburg - Reacting to a poster advertising the ANC's 111th anniversary statement on Sunday, January 8, which featured the face of ANC President Cyril Ramaphosa, ActionSA leader Herman Mashaba called on Ramaphosa in a social media post to shed light on the Phala Phala money laundering case. It seems as though the Phala Phala scandal is not forgotten by political leaders, as Mashaba affirmed that “This case is simply not just going to disappear," he tweeted. Last month, retired chief justice Sandile Ngcobo’s three-member Independent Section 89 Panel found that Ramaphosa had violated his oath of office in handling the break-in and theft of a huge amount of money in US dollars at his Phala Phala game farm. The panel found that Ramaphosa had committed four serious violations and that there was prima facie evidence against him. Ramaphosa survived a vote against the adoption of the Section 89 independent panel report on the scandal, but opposition parties vowed to continue the fight. IFP spokesperson Mkhuleko Hlengwa said this was a missed opportunity for parliament, which could have started a process for the president to come forward and answer. He said it was now up to the law enforcement agencies investigating the matter, including the Hawks, Sars, and the Reserve Bank, to investigate it fully. He said the failure by parliament to carry out its oversight function was "a dereliction of duty." Mashaba said history had repeated itself in parliament as the ANC again demonstrated that the party would always come before their oath of office, the Constitution, and the South African people.
