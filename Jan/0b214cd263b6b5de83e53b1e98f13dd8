Durban – eThekwini mayor Mxolisi Kaunda honoured the city’s top performing matriculants at the mayoral matric excellence awards ceremony held at Inkosi Albert Luthuli ICC on Friday. Kaunda said he was proud of the KwaZulu-Natal matric class of 2022 especially as the province’s pass rate was 83%, a significant improvement from the 77% achieved in 2021. “We are delighted to honour matric pupils who have outdone themselves to attain outstanding results despite the adversities of 2022. This was a challenging year with water shortages and no electricity and the April and May floods.” Kaunda added some of the challenges faced by the matric class of 2022 were caused by communities themselves. “Some communities when they have challenges with water and electricity, they go and shut down schools. We should not be allowing this, our schools should be allowed to function. We must defend our schools and say no to vandalism to our school infrastructure. We are proud of two districts in eThekwini which have achieved a pass rate over 80%. This includes uMlazi district with an 82.8% matric pass and Pinetown district with an 80.5% pass rate.” Theesen Narasimulu, who attended Kharwastan Secondary School, attained eight distinctions.  “I’m just glad to be invited to such a prestigious function and I want to thank the mayor’s office as well as KwaZulu-Natal. There is no secret to success, it’s just hard work, perseverance, dedication and a lot of sacrifice. Focus on what you want, strive and work hard for it.”  Anele Msweli from JG Zuma High School in KwaMashu achieved eight distinctions and 99% in Mathematics.  “I want to study at the University of Cape Town this year. I’m really ecstatic that I was nominated among the top pupils in eThekwini and received an award and bursary. I come from a less privileged home so this bursary will help me a lot. I want to thank my teachers and parents. To the class of 2023, I want to say you have to work hard and pray.” THE MERCURY
